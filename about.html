        <h1>Welcome to the hopeful news blog!</h1>
        <p>My name is Emma, and I’m the creator of this blog. 
            A few years ago, I found myself to be in a bad headspace. 
            I felt as though the world was getting worse and worse, and that there was no hope. 
        </p>
        <p>Luckily I went to my doctor for help, and she advised me to stop watching the news. 
            At the time, I also watched the amazing Hans Rosling TedTalks, and this combined with 
            help from my family and friends, made me feel a lot better. 
        </p>
        <p>Even though I knew that the world was getting better in so many ways, it still took me a 
            long time to be able to read the news without getting the feeling of hopelessness again.
        </p>
        <p>Now, I’m not saying that you should stop paying attention to what’s going on in the world. 
            The problem is when you only get to know about the bad stuff that is going on, and next to 
            nothing about what is getting better, as is often the case with news outlets. I think it’s 
            essential that we learn about the good news as well so we can stay motivated to keep changing 
            the world to the better. This is why I created this Blog. To find stories each week that makes me, 
            and hopefully you, happy and hopeful!
        </p>
